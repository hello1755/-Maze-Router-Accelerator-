In the midterm project of ICALB, we implement a router named "Maze Router", the goal is to complete the interconnection of all terminals and gurantee that each interconnection will not hindered by others.
1.AXI protocol

2.RTL coding algorithm design

3.Use of DRAM and SRAM

4.Synthesis and gate-level simulation
